# Split Expenses Backend

A backend for an expense-sharing application built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL2. This server powers an application that allows users to easily track shared expenses among group members, calculate each person's share, and view balances to settle debts at the end of a trip or event.

## Project Evolution

Initially, this backend was designed as a decoupled Node.js and Express.js application. However, after completing the project, we decided to integrate the backend functionality directly into the **Next.js frontend** using its **API Routes**. This approach simplified the deployment process and improved maintainability by consolidating the codebase into a single project.

The Next.js implementation can be found in my peerâ€™s repository:  
[Split Expenses with Next.js](https://github.com/amirsorayaei/split-expenses)

This repository remains as an example of the standalone backend implementation.
